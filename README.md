# POE2Radar

An external, mostly read-only **map/radar overlay for Path of Exile 2**.

It attaches to the PoE2 client, reads game state directly out of process memory (no injection, no
hooks), and draws a terrain + entity overlay on top of the game's map — plus an optional auto-flask
quality-of-life feature.

> ⚠️ **Use at your own risk.** This reads another process's memory and can send keystrokes to the
> game. Automating input may violate Path of Exile's Terms of Service and could put your account at
> risk. This is a personal/educational tool — you are responsible for how you use it.

## Features

- **Map overlay** — when the in-game map is open, draws the walkable-terrain mask + entity dots,
  projected player-centered onto the game's map.
- **Entity radar** — alive enemies (red), NPCs, chests, area transitions, other players, and
  **POIs** (anything the game flags with a minimap icon) shown with a ring.
- **Tile landmarks** — static features pulled from terrain tile data (boss arena, treasure, …),
  shown the moment you enter an area, before exploring.
- **Auto-flask** (opt-in input) — presses the life/mana flask key below a HP/mana threshold.
  Hard-gated: only when PoE2 is the foreground window, with cooldowns and an **F8 kill-switch**.
- **Live state API** — a small HTTP server (`localhost:7777`) for troubleshooting:
  `GET /state`, `GET /entities` (filters: `category`, `alive`, `radius`, `limit`), `GET /landmarks`.

## Build & run

Requires the **.NET 10 SDK**, Windows x64.

```
dotnet build POE2Radar.slnx
# launch with PoE2 already running and you in a zone:
src\POE2Radar.Overlay\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\POE2Radar.Overlay.exe
```

Reading another process generally requires running the overlay **as Administrator**.

Hotkeys: **F8** toggles auto-flask; **PageUp/PageDown** scale and **arrow keys** offset the map
projection (for calibration); **Home** resets.

## Architecture

Three projects:

- `src/POE2Radar.Core` — memory plumbing (`OpenProcess` + `ReadProcessMemory`), the PoE2 offset
  table (`Game/Poe2Offsets.cs`), and the live read layer (`Game/Poe2Live.cs`).
- `src/POE2Radar.Overlay` — the radar `.exe`: attaches, AOB-resolves the game roots, runs the tick
  loop, renders the Direct2D overlay, serves the API, and (opt-in) drives auto-flask input.
- `src/POE2Radar.Research` — dev-time offset discovery/validation tools (AOB scan, HP value-scan,
  entity/tile/UI probes, an area-change watcher). Never linked into the overlay binary.

## Offsets & patches

PoE2 memory offsets drift with game patches. Validated offsets live in `Game/Poe2Offsets.cs` and
are documented in [`resources/community-offsets.md`](resources/community-offsets.md). After a patch
that breaks reads, use the `POE2Radar.Research` probes to re-discover them (the doc describes the
workflow). There is no live oracle for PoE2, so validation is value-scan / manual.

## Credits

Memory-layout research and the AOB approach draw heavily on the open-source **GameHelper2** project
(its `GameOffsets` were the starting reference for PoE2's struct shapes). GameHelper2 is not
redistributed here; only independently re-validated offset values are recorded in this repo.
